## My process

### Built with

- React
- Axios
- Fake Store API
- Tailwind CSS
- Redux

### What I learned
I learnt a great deal about using Redux for my state management. I learnt about interacting with APIs and databases. 


### Continued development

For future projects, I intend exploring more HTTP methods in interaction with more APIs and I intend using more of REdux. I am also going to explore the use of useReducer, useContextAPI, useDebugger etc.
